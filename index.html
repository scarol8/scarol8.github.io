    <h1>Caroline Stewart</h1>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Caroline Stewart. I'm a computer science major with math and professional and technical writing minors.<br>
      I chose CS because I enjoy building things I can use, whether it's physically with my hands or with a computer program. I also enjoy the challenges I face when developing logic for a project.<br>
      I hope to build computational models for medical research after I graduate colege. Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher for NIMML at the Virginia Biocomplexity Institute, where I use machine learning to come up with algorithms to develop cures for Crohn's disease, C. diff, and colitis. <br>
      We have yet to figure out a cure, but I'm slowly learning what it takes to do so. With the abundant amount of resources that are available to myself and other researchers at NIMML, I believe that there will be some amazing discoveries in the near future.<br>
      Along with my computational modeling interests, I am also very passionate about "women in technology". I think it is so important for women to become involved in a field that is mostly made of men. There are so many opportunities for women to take part in the technological world, and I like to help get that word out (JOIN AWC!!!). <br>

      Lastly, I have love animals. To the right is a picture of me and my dog, Yogi, when I rescued him from the Montgomery Animal Shelter a last year. Even though I have a dog of my own now (which is a lot more work than I'd expected), still go to the shelter to walk the dogs. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCFACC/?fref=ts"><h3>Click here to see when there are volunteer dog walking hours and when dogs get taken to the shelter!</a><br></br>They need love, too!<br></h3>

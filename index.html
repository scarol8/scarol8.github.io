      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Caroline Stewart. I'm a computer science major with math and progrssional and technical writing minors.</p>
      <p>I chose CS because I enjoy building things I can use, whether it's physically with my hands or a computer program. I also enjoy the challenges I face when developing logic for a project.</p>
      <p>I hope to build computational models for medical research after I graduate colege. Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher for NIMML at the Virginia Biocomplexity Institute, where I use machine learning come up with algorithms to develop cures for Chrone's disease. </p>
      <p>I have yet to figure out a cure, but I'm slowly learning what it takes to do so. With the abundant amount of resources that are available to myself and other researchers at NIMML, I believe that there will be some amazing discoveries in the near future.</p>
      <p> Along with my computational modeling interests, I am also very passionate about "women in technology". I think it is so important for women to become involved in a field that is mostly made of men. There are so many opportunities for women to take part in the technological world, and I like to help get that word out (JOIN AWC!!!). </p>

											<h3>Background</h3>
											<p>John Volk is a friend of mine who I interned with this past summer at Rackspace. He's been in several of my computer science classes and has agreed to talk to me about his journey with Crohn's Disease. </p>


											<h3>Rough Outline of Interview Questions</h3>
											<h5>-Tell me a little about yourself and your interests.</h5>
											<p>	John is from Pennsylvania and enjoys playing ultimate Frisbee.</p>
											<h5>-I learned you had Crohn’s disease when we were both eating lunch in the breakroom a few weeks after our internship started. You were eating chicken and rice and I was pretty shocked when you told me you had Crohn’s. I thought that didn’t fit with the dietary restrictions. So what are your restrictions for eating?</h5>
											<p>John’s sister has ulcerative colitis and was told to eat more fiber. This is not the case for him. His doctor told him to stick to a low-residue diet where he avoids certain foods with fiber. He mostly eats a lot of carbs and less fruits and vegetables.</p>
											<h5>-Are you usually that open about your condition?</h5>
											<p>There are times where he’s “emotionally swinging” around where it just comes out but there’s also no shame behind it. He’s an advocate for raising awareness.</p>
											<h5>-When did you discover you had Crohn’s Disease?</h5>
											<p>April 11, 2016</p>
											<h5>-How long did it take you to discover you had it?</h5>
											<p>“Too long.” He was diagnosed with IBS a few years ago, but early summer of 2015, he realized there were more problems. He had 2 surgeries in the fall of 2015 that were red flags. The biopsy during the spring break of 2016 did not look good, so he took a blood test to look for markers of Crohn’s Disease. This confirmed his Crohn’s.</p>
											<h5>-How did you feel when you found out? Did you know deep down?</h5>
											<p>His parents were trying to work stuff out as if he had it, but he was in denial. When he got the phone call, he shut down; not necessarily because he wasn’t ok with it, but because of relief and stress.</p>
											<h5>-How were you able to pick yourself up and go do the internship a month after finding out?</h5>
											<p>He was happy to do something where he could apply himself and do something he’s good at – computer science. School, on the other hand, was more difficult to do since he was not healthy, which put him in the position to fail.</p>
											<h5>-What was your definition of Crohn’s before you had it/what did you know about Crohn’s?</h5>
											<p>The Wikipedia page doesn’t do justice as to what it really feels to have Crohn’s. He said that you can read it and say, “yeah, that sucks”, but it’s not awful. He thought it was weird bowel movements and stomach hurting, but with his experience of the malnutrition and physical exhaustion, he’s realized it’s much more.</p>
											<h5>-What’s your definition of it now? (your point of view, especially since you’ve probably read a lot about it)</h5>
											<p>He said that he can’t give a better definition than the textbook, but it’s a debilitating illness that is not to be taken lightly.</p>
											<h5>-Does Crohn’s run in your family?</h5>
											<p>Yes, on his dad’s side. His aunt had to get her colon removed. His sister has ulcerative colitis and his younger brother is starting to get IBS symptoms.</p>
											<h5>-When did your sister start getting symptoms?</h5>
											<p>Around the same time – the first year or two of college.</p>
											<h5>-What did doctors tell you? (what they originally thought it was/treatment options/severity/how long it took them to figure it out)</h5>
											<p>He said that initially, he was diagnosed with IBS, which fixed itself relatively quickly with antibiotics, which wipe out all bacteria. Then when it came back, a few years later, he said that he started pressing for more information. He signed up for another test that eventually came through with the information. Recovering from the surgeries was a lot. He didn’t start meds until the beginning of the summer.</p>
											<h5>-Did C. diff come to mind?</h5>
											<p>He did a stool test that came back negative, but he doesn’t know a ton about it.</p>
											<h5>-Do you know anything about current Crohn’s Disease research or treatments?</h5>
											<p>In terms of research, no. Treatment-wise, his sister takes Humera and another drug for immune-suppressant. He only takes Humera. There’s a couple new drugs that are probably the same.</p>
											<h5>-What is your hope for the future of Crohn’s Disease? </h5>
											<p>A greater awareness would’ve been helpful along the way. Being able to take off from school would’ve been extremely helpful. Maybe college is too stressful. How can we not trigger this?</p>
											<h5>-Now that you know about this research, would you like to add any thoughts?</h5>
											<p>One aspect that doesn’t get seen as much: He's been suffering depression, from what he knows about, for a couple months. There’s been a lot of physical and mental stuff other than his stomach hurting. He started taking steroids after his surgery and until the end of May, he was physically ok, but not emotionally ok.</p>
											<h5>-How does Crohn’s affect working out or putting strain on your body?</h5>
											<p>It stops him when he’s in enough pain to do something, but it doesn’t stop him with exercise. He’s also prevented a lot of things that would put stress on his body, like making sure he gets enough sleep.</p>
											<h5>-What do you know about C. diff?</h5>
											<p>He thinks it’s an infection in the digestive tract that wipes out a lot of bacteria and causes a lot of issues.</p>

											<h3>My Summary</h3>
											<p>This interview with John put Crohn's into perspective for me and made me realize an important point: it's difficult to deal with Crohn's Disease. It’s also really hard to know what to do in a situation like John's. He didn't know he actually had Crohn's for sure, but the process was long enough, strenuous enough, and mentally-draining enough to set him back at school and cause depression. Should he have dropped as soon as he started showing symptoms? How was he to know how bad it would get? The suggestions on what to eat, the treatments, surgeries, and tests his doctors gave, and the advice he was given on what it could possibly be were too spaced out and too broad. There should be more research on the disease, more concrete ways to pinpoint diseases with similar symptoms, and more awareness in general on Crohn’s Disease. </p>
